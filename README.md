The game you can't win. A simple platform game where you have to choose which anti-EU headlines were actually printed by the British press (hint: more than you might first imagine).  You control Theresa May, who has to masterfully pick the green 'yes' tick or the red 'no' cross, depending on if you agree if the headline is correct.  Each of which will increase/decrease public gullibility or anger.  These can be further reduced by drinking the beers that appear on the selection of the wrong answer...  but be warned, choosing the correct answer will result in the deployment of the English flag.  Avoid Nationalism  at all costs.

This game was created using the Phaser library and Javascript for the first project of Ironhack Berlin.
